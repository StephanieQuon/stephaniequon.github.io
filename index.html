<h3>Signal Processing and App Development Team Member</h3>
<h5><font size="4"> UBC Biomedical Engineering Student Team | September 2019 - Present</font></h5>
<p> I am part of UBC BEST's neurotech team: MINT! This team works to build a working electroencephalogram (EEG) for the fixed

<h3>The Sprouts Initiative</h3>
<h5><font size="4"> Founder and President | August 2017 - Present</font></h5>
<p> In August 2017, I founded the Sprouts Initiative! The organization focuses on three pillars: accessibility, sustainability, and community engagament.
So far, we've received $67,000 in grants, and involved 300+ individuals in leadership! Our sustainability projects include donating 10,000+ end-of-day meals
(2017), distributing 2,250 reusable straws across Canada (2018), collecting 1000+ pledges (2018). Our community engagement projects include distributing 3,000
stickers and 10,000 cards for an interactive art project (2020), donating 500 care packages (2019), our COVID-19 Stories Project (2020), and other COVID-19
relief projects that we received $6000 in grants for (2020). Our accessibility projects include winning $50,000 over 7 grant projects to fund accessible
technology with partner organizations across Canada. We've received recognition through Scotiabank, The Canadian Wildlife Federation, The Globe and Mail,
Bloomberg, The Canadian Museum of Nature, NAAEE, and more! I'm super grateful for the opportunity to do this work, and more exciting projects are in the
works! Please note that it is not ideal that I post information about the initiative here. I do not want to draw attention to myself, but rather the work
we've done. However, a website is expensive, and we decided that our funding would be better spent on our core projects.  </p>
