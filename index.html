									<h3>Neuroethics Canada - NEST Lab</h3>
									<h5> <font size="4">Research Assistant   |    September 2020 - Present </font></h5>
								<p>
									As part of the NEST (Neuroscience, Engagement, and Smart Technology) lab, I am working on a qualitative study on social stigma in the use of social robots with older adults, 
									and programming a demo for the MiRo robot!
								</p>


									<h3>UBC Computer Science</h3>
									<h5><font size="4">Teaching Assistant  -  APSC 160   |   September 2020 - Present</font></h5>
								<p>
									As a TA for  APSC 160, Computation in Engineering, I help to answer student questions during lecture
									sessions, invigilate lab tests and midterm/final exams, mark labs
									and exams, and answer questions on an online question platform and during office hours.
								</p>


									<h3>BC Children's Hospital Research Institute - Digital Health Innovation Lab</h3>
									<h5><font size="4">Software Developer   |   May 2020 - Present</font></h5>
								<p>
									I received an NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Award from UBC
										to pursue a research project at BC Children's Hospital Research Institue
										this summer! In this role, I am working to develop a smartphone video-based
										respiratory rate tracking tool for infants using machine learning and computer
										vision tools in MATLAB. I recieved a best presentation award for this
										project!
								</p>


									<h3>UBC Biomedical Engineering Student Team</h3>
									<h5><font size="4">Signal Processing Team Member   |   September 2019 - Present</font></h5>
								<p> This past year, I have been part of UBC BEST, the biomedical engineering design team.
									I joined MINT, the neurotech team which works to build a working electroencephalogram (EEG)
									from scratch for the NeuroTechX competition! As part of the signal processing subteam,
									I helped collect data with a working EEG and process this data in MATLAB to remove artifacts.
