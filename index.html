<header> <h2>Technical Experience</h2> </header>
	
<h3>Software Engineering Intern</h3>
<h5> <font size="4"> Microsoft | May 2021 - August 2021 </font></h5>
<p> Excited to see what I'll work on at Microsoft Garage! </p>
	
<h3>Research Assistant</h3>
<h5> <font size="4"> BC Centre for Disease Control | May 2021 - Present </font></h5>
<p> At the BC Centre for Disease Control's Public Health Bioinformatic Lab, I am working on developing a tool to 
query a biobank, using a Next-Generation Biobanking Ontology. </p>

<h3>Research Assistant</h3>
<h5> <font size="4"> Neuroscience, Engagement, and Smart Technology Lab | September 2020 - April 2021 </font></h5>
<p> As a research assistant at the NEST (Neuroscience, Engagement, and Smart Technology) lab of Neuroethics Canada, my 
work consisted of programming and designing interactive robotics demonstrations (Python, C), and leading a 
study focused on stigma and emotional alignment in the use of social robots with older adults. </p>

<h3>Undergraduate Teaching Assistant</h3>
<h5><font size="4">UBC Department of Computer Science | September 2020 - April 2021 </font></h5>
<p> As a TA for APSC 160 Computation in Engineering, an introductory programming class on C, I
helped answer questions from students during lecture, helped students debug their code, and marked exams. </p>

<h3>Software Developer</h3>
<h5><font size="4">Digital Health Innovation Lab, BC Children's Hospital Research | May 2020 - April 2021 </font></h5>
<p> For the summer of 2020, I received an NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Award from UBC. I worked on a project titled
"Smartphone Video-Based Respiratory Rate Tracking for Infants". Leading this project, I utilized computer vision and signal 
processing tools (MATLAB) to create an algorithm that stabilizes videos, identifies tracking stickers, tracks movement, and 
estimates respiratory rate from video. I then worked as a developer for cross-platform app with synchronous recording and 
haptic feedback features, for use in a global health study in Lilongwe, Malawi (Java, C++, Scheme, LambdaNative). </p>

<h3>Signal Processing and App Development Team Member</h3>
<h5><font size="4"> UBC Biomedical Engineering Student Team | September 2019 - Present</font></h5>
<p> I am part of UBC BEST's neurotech team: MINT! This team works to build a working electroencephalogram (EEG) for the fixed
and open challenges of the NeuroTechX competition. On the team, I am responsible for analyzing EEG signals (MATLAB), and developing 
the login/database of an Android app (Java, Android Studio). </p>
	
<header> <h2>The Sprouts Initiative</h2> </header>
<p> In August 2017, I founded the Sprouts Initiative! The organization focuses on three pillars: accessibility, sustainability, and community engagament. 
So far, we've received $67,000 in grants, and involved 300+ individuals in leadership! Our 
sustainability projects include donating 10,000+ end-of-day meals (2017), distributing 2,250 reusable straws across Canada (2018), collecting 1000+ pledges 
(2018). Our community engagement projects include distributing 3,000 stickers and 10,000 cards for an interactive art project (2020), donating 500 care packages 
(2019), our COVID-19 Stories Project (2020), and other COVID-19 relief projects that we received $6000 in grants for (2020). Our accessibility projects include 
winning $50,000 over 7 grant projects to fund accessible technology with partner organizations across Canada. We've received recognition through Scotiabank, 
The Canadian Wildlife Federation, The Globe and Mail, Bloomberg, The Canadian Museum of Nature, NAAEE, and more! I'm super grateful for the opportunity 
to do this work, and more exciting projects are in the works! </p>
