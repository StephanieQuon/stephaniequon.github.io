<header> <h2>Technical Experience</h2> </header>

<h3>Research Assistant</h3>
<h5> <font size="4"> Neuroscience, Engagement, and Smart Technology Lab | September 2020 - Present </font></h5>
<p> I am a research assistant at the NEST (Neuroscience, Engagement, and Smart Technology) lab of Neuroethics Canada! 
My work consists of programming and designing interactive robotics demonstrations (Python, C), and leading a 
study focused on stigma and emotional alignment in the use of social robots with older adults. </p>

<h3>Undergraduate Teaching Assistant</h3>
<h5><font size="4">UBC Department of Computer Science | September 2020 - Present</font></h5>
<p> I am a TA for APSC 160 Computation in Engineering, an introductory programming class on C. In this role, I
help answer questions from students during lecture, help students debug their code, and mark exams. </p>

<h3>Software Developer</h3>
<h5><font size="4">Digital Health Innovation Lab, BC Children's Hospital Research | May 2020 - Present</font></h5>
<p> For the summer of 2020, I received an NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Award from UBC. I worked on a project titled
"Smartphone Video-Based Respiratory Rate Tracking for Infants". Leading this project, I utilized computer vision and signal 
processing tools (MATLAB) to create an algorithm that stabilizes videos, identifies tracking stickers, tracks movement, and 
estimates respiratory rate from video. I am now working as a developer for cross-platform app with synchronous recording and 
haptic feedback features, for use in a global health study in Lilongwe, Malawi (Java, C++, Scheme, LambdaNative). </p>

<h3>Signal Processing and App Development Team Member</h3>
<h5><font size="4"> UBC Biomedical Engineering Student Team | September 2019 - Present</font></h5>
<p> I am part of UBC BEST's neurotech team: MINT! This team works to build a working electroencephalogram (EEG) for the fixed
and open challenges of the NeuroTechX competition. On the team, I am responsible for analyzing EEG signals (MATLAB), and developing 
the login/database of an Android app (Java, Android Studio). </p>

<header> <h2>Leadership & Volunteer Experience</h2> </header>

<h3>Social Coordinator, Community Engagement Co-chair</h3>
<h5><font size="4">UBC Women in Engineering |  July 2020 - Present </font></h5>
<p> As the social coordinator of Women in Engineering at UBC, I lead the community engagement committee, which organizes
monthly events that foster community and belonging within the club and the wider engineering community. </p>
	
<h3>Grants and Development Volunteer</h3>
<h5><font size="4">Crisis Intervention & Suicide Prevention Centre of BC |  June 2020 - Present </font></h5>
<p> As a volunteer at the BC Crisis Centre, I help write grant application, news updates, and sponsorship letters.
I have worked on developing mindfulness programming and researching non-profit organizations. </p>

<h3>Interdisciplinary Outreach Committee Co-Chair</h3>
<h5><font size="4"> UBC Undergraduate Research Opportunities | April 2020 - Present </font></h5>
<p> As co-chair of the Interdisciplinary Outreach Committee, I co-lead a team that plans and executes research-related events and programs
for students pursuing or looking to pursue research outside of life sciences. I lead a research project exploring undergraduates' perceptions
of research opportunities and created a research resource guide based on the results. </p>

<h3>Founder & President</h3>
<h5><font size="4">The Sprouts Initiative | August 2019 - Present </font></h5>
<p> In August 2017, I started The Sprouts Initiative, an organization focused on 3 pillars: Accessibility, Sustainability, and Wellbeing.
The organization has received over $40,000 in grants and involved 100+ youth in leadership and programs, with recognition from The Globe and
Mail, Bloomberg, The Canadian Wildlife Federation, and more. Some of our successful projects include distributing thousands of reusable straws 
across Canada, donating over 10,000 end-of-day meals to shelters, winning federal grants to help organizations upgrade their accessibility, 
and organizing COVID-19 relief projects with over $5,000 in funding. </p>
